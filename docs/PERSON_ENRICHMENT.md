# Person Enrichment API

## Overview

The Person Enrichment API enables you to enrich data on a person by performing a one-to-one match of this person with the nearly three billion individual profiles that are hosted in our dataset. Once matched, you have access to all the fields in our [Person Schema](https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/fields), which can include names, addresses, employment information and social media accounts.
