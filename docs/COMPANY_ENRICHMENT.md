# Company Enrichment API

## Overview

The Company Enrichment API lets you enrich data on a company by performing a one-to-one match of this company with the numerous company profiles that are hosted on our site. Once matched, you have access to all the fields in our [Company Schema](https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/company-fields).
